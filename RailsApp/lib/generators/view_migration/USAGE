    Generates migrations for creating, droping and altering database views.

    It also generates sql files that contain the SELECT statement used for creating the views.

    rails generate view_migration CreateConversationSummaries

    This will create:
        db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_create_converstation_summaries.rb
        db/views/converstation_summaries/[TIMESTAMP]_converstation_summaries.sql


    rails generate view_migration DropConversationSummaries

    This will create:
        db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_drop_converstation_summaries.rb


    rails alter view_migration AlterConversationSummaries

    This will create:
        db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_alter_converstation_summaries.rb
        db/views/converstation_summaries/[TIMESTAMP]_converstation_summaries.sql
